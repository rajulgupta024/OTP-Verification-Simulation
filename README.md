# OTP-Verification-Simulation

Overview
This Python script implements an OTP (One-Time Password) verification system. The system generates a 6-digit OTP and simulates sending it to the user's email address for verification. Upon receiving the OTP, the user enters it into the system for validation. If the entered OTP matches the generated OTP, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.

Project Structure
otp_verification_system.py: Python script containing the implementation of the OTP verification system.
README.md: Documentation explaining the functionality of each function, how to run the program, and any dependencies required.
test_cases.py: Test cases to ensure the system functions correctly under various scenarios, including correct and incorrect OTP entries (optional).
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the script (if any).
Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website (Python.org).

Usage
Run the Python script otp_verification.py:
python otp_verification_system.py

Enter your email address when prompted.

Check the console output for the generated OTP.
